# NEMA 17 Shinano Kenshi SolidWorks Design  

This repository contains the 3D design and modeling files for the NEMA 17 Shinano Kenshi stepper motor, created using SolidWorks. The design is tailored for use in robotics, CNC machines, and other precision engineering projects.  

## Features  
- **Accurate 3D Model**: Detailed dimensions and features of the NEMA 17 Shinano Kenshi stepper motor.  
- **SolidWorks Compatibility**: Files are created in SolidWorks for easy customization and modification.  
- **Engineering Ready**: Ideal for simulations, prototyping, and integration into mechanical assemblies.  

## Files Included  
- **CAD Files**: SolidWorks part and assembly files (.SLDPRT and .SLDASM).  
- **Technical Drawings**: Exported PDFs of the motor design for reference.  
- **Step File**: Universal STEP file for compatibility with other CAD software.  

## Requirements  
- **Software**: SolidWorks 2018 or later (for original files).  
- **Optional**: Any CAD software capable of opening STEP files for universal use.
